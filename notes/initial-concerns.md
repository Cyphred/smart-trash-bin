Job length and rate:
Approx. 15 man hours @ Php. 240/hr

Concerns to discuss:
1. Current state of device will not work.
   - No checking for GSM readiness.
   - No checking for GSM errors.
   - No checking for SMS send status.
   - No external way of detecting errors.
     - Maybe implement an audio or visual diagnostic system? Otherwise will have to rely on my presence during testing/demonstration.
   - Distance detection is instantaneous - momentarily blocking the ultrasonic sensor may trigger false positives.

2. Timeframe is extremely short for implementation of full features.
